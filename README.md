# üåø Plant Disease Detection Website

This project is a web application powered by artificial intelligence that allows users to upload images of their plants and flowers to detect possible diseases. The system uses a deep learning model (MobileNetV2) to analyze the image and return the result to the user.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Django** ‚Äì Main backend framework  
- **Redis & Celery** ‚Äì For task queue and background processing  
- **SQLite** ‚Äì Lightweight local database  
- **HTML & CSS** ‚Äì Frontend design  
- **MobileNetV2** ‚Äì Deep learning model for image classification  

## üß† About the AI Model

We used the **MobileNetV2** model, which is lightweight, fast, and suitable for web-based applications. The trained model runs on the server side and processes the uploaded image to detect any plant diseases.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/doustack/PlantVillage.git
cd repo-name

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Django server
python manage.py runserver
```

## Note: To use Celery and Redis, start Redis first, then run Celery with:
```bash
celery -A project_name worker --loglevel=info
```
